# Mobile App Stores

App stores form the core of the mobile world where apps can be downloaded and reviewed. Without the app stores, smartphones wouldn’t be as intelligent
and functional as we want them to be. 

The app stores of the biggest mobile platforms — Google and Apple — contain millions of apps. Billions of app downloads have been counted. These are huge numbers that are bound to increase in the future.

[__Google Play Store__](https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en)
- Hosts movies and other content as well as apps, was one of the first mobile app stores.
- It opened its doors in 2008 and exclusively targets the Android market.

[__Apple App Store__](https://www.apple.com/app-store/)
- For iOS users, the Apple Store is often the first place to look for amazing new applications. 
- According to [Lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-apps-in-app-store-2000252), the Apple Store contains 2.1 million apps, though that number includes apps developed specifically for Apple TV and Apple Watch, among other products.

Besides the Big Two app stores from Apple and Google, there are other stores sponsored by device manufacturers and network operators. The following list is not complete but contains some other app stores for the different mobile platforms.

[__Samsung Galaxy Apps__](https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/galaxy-store/)
- Many device manufacturers have discovered that they can integrate their customers more fully under their brands by offering mobile app stores of their own.

[__LG SmartWorld__](https://www.lg.com/global/lg-thinq)
- LG has a similar mobile app store, called SmartWorld, that is automatically installed on LG phones. 
- This store also offers applications that are designed for LG TVs and other devices.

[__Huawei App Store__](http://appstore.huawei.com/)
- This mobile app store is primarily targeted to the Chinese market, with most app names and descriptions written in Chinese characters. 
- Huawei is installed on many of the company’s devices and allows people in countries without access to the Play Store to download the apps they want to use.

[__Sony Apps__](https://www.sony.com/apps.html)
- Like several of its competitors, the Sony Apps market is designed for people with Sony mobile devices who want to search natively on their phones or tablets without turning to Google Play. 
- It’s geared primarily toward entertainment, but you can also find plenty of brand apps that offer other functionality.

[__Amazon Appstore__](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23972942011&ref_=cs_fdm_1000626391-23972942011)
- It’s no surprise that ecommerce giant Amazon has branched into the app space. The Amazon Appstore hosts Android apps and comes preinstalled on devices like the Fire Phone and the Kindle Fire in place of the Play Store.
- Remember that consumers take the road of least resistance to get what they want. If they already have the Amazon Appstore on their device, they’ll search for an app they want there first, before downloading another marketplace.
- When your app appears for these customers, you save them the trouble of downloading more stores to their devices, which can help not only with brand recognition but also with brand loyalty.
- Plus, consumers with any Android-powered device can download the Amazon Appstore. As we’ve seen in other areas of commerce, Amazon tends to dominate the spaces it infiltrates, so expect downloads to increase.

But why are there so many different stores? Especially in the Android world there is more than one app store available, such as the Amazon and Samsung stores. The answer to this question is simple: every app store provider wants tomake money out of the mobile app business!

Let’s take the Samsung store as an example. Since the launch of its Galaxy device series, Samsung has grown to become one of the biggest and most
successful Android device manufacturers and has sold and continues to sell millions of devices around the world. Having its own app store preinstalled on
every Samsung phone is a huge advantage because it directs potential mobile app customers straight to Samsung and away from Google. If millions of users
use this store, the store generates traffic, which means it can sell ads. On top of that, app sales via the app store allow Samsung to generate additional revenues. In most of the app stores, 30% of the sale price goes to the platform provider, and the same applies to in-app purchases.

I think this is indicative of why there are so many different mobile app stores. If you search the Internet, I’m sure you’ll find even more of them.

Before a mobile team distributes an app in the biggest stores, they should think about the goals of the app. Maybe there are other stores that are better
suited to their app than the big players. For example, some stores offer a better revenue share than the usual 70% (developer revenues)/30% (store provider revenues) split, or they offer better app targeting, for example, in different markets such as Africa or Asia.

However, uploading an app to one of the stores requires one thing in particular — knowledge of the store’s review and publishing process. Your app needs to fulfill the review and publishing guidelines of the various vendors and app stores; otherwise your app is very likely to be rejected.

Knowledge of the different review guidelines will allow you to better support your team while developing and releasing your app. The review and publishing guidelines of the major mobile app stores can be found on the following Web sites:
- Amazon Appstore Guidelines(https://developer.amazon.com/help/faq.html)
- Apple App Store Guidelines (https://developer.apple.com/appstore/review/)
- Google Play store Guidelines (http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/publish/preparing.html)
- Samsung App Store Guidelines (http://developer.samsung.com/distribute/app-submission-guide)
